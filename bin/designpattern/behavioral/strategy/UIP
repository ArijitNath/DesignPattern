The strategy design pattern is used in the Pull and Push workflow
The protocolMetadataService interface has 2 implementations :
	1. For the pull workflow, it has to read from the ProtocolMetadataDB.json file
	2. For Push Workflow, it has to write to the file
	
The two separate implementations are sent to the ProtocolMetadataScevice for the 2 separate workflows
